** Introduction to SAS **;
* Session 2 Exercise

- Create a libref to your flash drive or network drive (LIBNAME statement)

- Create a new, temporary data set called 'males' based on classone.classds

-	Limit the data set to males (males have a value of 1 for gender)

-	Limit the data set to the variables gender, race, age, and borough.  

-	Create a new variable called "ethnicity" which has the following values: 
when race is: 		ethnicity is:
1					Hispanic
2					white
3					black
4					Asian
5					other
99					unknown

- The data set you create (called males) should have 1350 observations and 5
variables

- When your code looks good, alter it to make the new data set permanent, and
then re-run it

- Have both the permanent classds and males data sets with you to future
classes.
